Projects from CS250 in Fall 2024 with Dr. Daniel Sorin

Homework 3: non-recursive C code that prints the Nth number of a sequence for 3^N - 3, recursive C code that computes f(N) = 2 * (N + 1) + 3 * [f(N-1)] - 17, and a dynamically memory allocated linked list that prints the rankings of golfers based on their relationship to the par.

Homework 4: MIPs code for the same problems from Homework 3.

Homework 5: Logisim circuits designed from given truth tables, a 16-bit ripple-carry adder/subtractor that performs A + B if input is zero and A - B if input is 1, and a finite state machine for a robot (according to the specifications in the Homework 5 directions).

Homework 6: a 16-bit MIPs-like, word-addressed RISC architecture designed in Logisim.

Homework 7: Java simulator of a single-level cache and the memory underneath it; the replacement policy is FIFO.
